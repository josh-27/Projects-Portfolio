Key Insights Summary:
Sales and Price Comparison: Categories like "Health & Household" stand out for high sales but lower average prices, which suggests high demand for lower-priced, essential products.

Sales and Discounts Relationship: While discounts do not appear to have a strong correlation with sales, categories with higher-priced products, such as smart home devices, tend to offer larger discounts. This could imply an effort to make premium products more attractive through discount strategies, but sales performance may rely more on product relevance than on discounts alone.

Low-Sales Categories: Categories with zero or low sales, such as "Tablet Replacement Parts" or "Smart Locks," might represent untapped potential. Investing in these areas could require strategies that go beyond discounts, such as market education, better product marketing, or pricing adjustments.

High Discounts in Smart Home Products: The high discount rates in smart home-related categories suggest a competitive market. Sellers in this niche may need to innovate or focus on unique selling points other than discounts to gain market share.

Ratings vs. Sales: High ratings don't always translate into high sales. For example, "Industrial & Scientific" products have top ratings but lower sales than "Health & Household." This could indicate that while customer satisfaction is important, factors like pricing, product type, or marketing efforts are critical in driving volume.

Additional Recommendations:
Explore Market Demand: Categories like "Smart Home" show potential despite lower sales, especially given the larger discounts. Investigating current market demand for these products could guide the seller on whether to focus on these emerging trends.

Experiment with Pricing Strategies: For high-discount categories, evaluate the effectiveness of pricing strategies to ensure that discounts are driving value without eroding profit margins.
