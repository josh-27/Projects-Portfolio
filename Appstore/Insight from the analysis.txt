Insight from the analysis

Paid apps have better ratings than the free ones, and on average, the price is $1.72.
An app with a good rating seems to support at least 30 languages; more than this is not necessary.
There are lower average ratings within the books, catalogs, and finance genres.
The genres with higher ratings are productivity, music, and video.
Apps with long descriptions (more than 1000 words) have more positive ratings, showing a positive correlation between these two factors.
The recommendations would be to create an app within the genres of books, catalogs, and finance because there is an opportunity there. Include a description of more than 1000 words, and avoid genres such as productivity, music, or games. Lastly, if it's a paid app, ensure that the price is not higher than $2.00.
