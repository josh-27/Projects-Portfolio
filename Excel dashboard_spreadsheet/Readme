Project info
This project is about bike buyer info, the spreadsheet has multiple 
information regarding the buyer, the information include from the region 
to his professional ocupation, gender, commute distane and even country.

For this project I did the following actions:

First eliminate the duplciates using the excel. 

To elimiate duplicates, first you hace to select al the spreedshet and 

then you would have to go to the data label.

Then i created a pivor table. 

I used pivot tables to create the visualitaions and then the dynamic filter 

on the app.

Insert a graph using the pick table as reference

The reason I created a dynamic table is becasue if changes are made in the
in the table it extend to the graph.
